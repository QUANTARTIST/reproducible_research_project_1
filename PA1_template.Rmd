# Loading and preprocessing the data
## Load the dataset

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
## This code will sum steps by day and create a histogram

hist(steps_per_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="green", xlab="Number of Steps")

## This code will calculate the mean and median number of steps per day

mean <- mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median <- median(steps_per_day$steps)

# What is the average daily activity pattern?
## This code will time series plot of the average number of steps taken and first, exclude NA values

# Imputing missing values

# Number of NAs in original data set

# This strategy for filling in NAs substitutes the missing steps with the average # 5-minute interval based on the day of the week
# Create the average number of steps per weekday and interval

# Form a dataset with all NAs for substitution

nadata<- data[is.na(data$steps),]

# Combine NA data with average weekday interval for substitution

newdata<-merge(nadata, avgTable, by=c("interval", "day"))


# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing # data populated
# Reorder the new substituded data in the same format as clean data set

# Mean of Steps with NA data taken care of:

# The new mean of the imputed data is 10821 steps compared to the old mean of 10766 steps. This equates a difference of 55 steps on average per day. The new median of the imputed data is 11015 steps compared to the old median of 10765 steps. This leads to a difference of 250 steps for the median. The overall shape of the distribution is consistent.
